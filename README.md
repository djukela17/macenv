# My MacOS work environment

I am using "10 static desktops" that span across both displays. I haven't tested
this configuration with different displays having separate desktops each.

## MacOS Preferences


### Mission Control

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Note**

Number of visible **Switch to Desktop X** shortcuts, depends on the number of 
desktops you have opened (If you have opened 4 desktops, you will not see
**Switch to Desktop 5** or above). To "fix" this, you can manually create more
desktops and then assign the shortcuts.
