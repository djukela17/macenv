### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Note**

Number of visible **Switch to Desktop X** shortcuts, depends on the number of 
desktops you have opened (If you have opened 4 desktops, you will not see
**Switch to Desktop 5** or above). To "fix" this, you can manually create more
desktops and then assign the shortcuts.
